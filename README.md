# Baguette Ballett

### Mother duck needs to feed her children and luckily a boy throws bread to her

Of course, humans know that bread isn't good for ducks - but mother duck knows better!

Help her feed her ducklings, don't let the bread mold and don't let it fall, those little ducklings are very hungry!
