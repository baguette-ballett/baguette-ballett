# Baguette Ballett

Mother duck needs to feed her children[^children] and luckily there's a boy[^boy] with lots of baguettes.

Be efficient and _balance_ the baguettes on your head, so you need fewer trips to the pond to feed your ducklings. Running around with a stack of baguettes on your head requires precision and poise, just like in ballet practice.

Don't let the bread go moldy[^moldy] and don't let it fall[^fall], those little ducklings are very hungry!

[^boy]: his name is probably Francois or Jacques, definitely very French
[^children]: see if we actually implemented ducklings in issues [#18](https://github.com/baguette-ballett/baguette-ballett/issues/18) and [#19](https://github.com/baguette-ballett/baguette-ballett/issues/19)
[^moldy]: see if we actually implemented moldy bread in issue [#21](https://github.com/baguette-ballett/baguette-ballett/issues/21)
[^fall]: dropped bread is lost forever, so be careful to catch it
